## About KINGPIN
Kingpin is a website dedicated to fantasy world-building, character design, and story writing centered around the following plot: Six students, five sectors, four pieces of a card spell powerful enough to save Koranin from the clutches of evil, or bring it closer and closer to the brink of humanity's destruction. They say not to bite the hand that feeds you, but what happens when you discover the hand has been poisoning you all along?

This is a collaboration project between my friend (Design Major @ UC Davis '24) and I (CS Major @ UC Davis '23). We split the project roles based on our specialties:
- __ahmpersand__: design mockups of pages using Adobe Photoshop 
- __moreminttea__: implement mockups using React.js (npm) and draw illustrations of world and characters (currently in progress)
- __both__: write world and character descriptions and stories
